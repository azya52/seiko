### A few technical details
This watch has a full-fledged graphics mode, in which you can control each pixel of the screen independently. But this mode involves sending graphic data directly in the process of generating an image on the LCD matrix. So, for each line, the display controller waits for 16 bytes of graphic data, 5 least significant bits are used from each, 10 bytes form a visible image, the remaining 6 are apparently used by the controller with large matrix sizes. And only then does it move on to the next line. The transfer of 16 bytes takes 16 machine cycles, with some tricks you can limit yourself to 12 cycles. 12 machine cycles are 96 clock cycles, so it takes 3072/2 clock cycles to completely regenerate the display (we divide by two, since the display is controlled by two independent drivers). In total, at a frequency of 32768 Hz, the maximum display refresh rate in graphics mode is only ~ 21.3 Hz, which is noticeable by eye, but generally tolerable, if it were not for the fact that for some useful work between frames, you need to switch to text mode, in which refresh rate is 64Hz. And this switching between frequencies is so noticeable that I had to abandon the idea of using the graphics mode to write the game.

Then I decided to use the text mode in the "Race the Beam" style - by tracking the current drawing line, you can change the character in a certain location, the pattern of which on the current line suits us to display the desired picture. Unfortunately, there are only 4 instructions for each line and the character set does not cover all possible combinations of pixels, so, for example, I could not draw a tolerable T-Rex in this way, but that was enough for the main character of the new game. And no flicker. I used the graphical mode only for the start screen.
